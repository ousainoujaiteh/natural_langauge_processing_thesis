									MY ACTIVITY REPORT	

#### ACTIVITIES

 PAST DAYS

I have been reading from the Deep Learning Book and also making some googling and watching videos on youtube to understand the architecture of Recurrent Neural Network and LTSM in general. And I also created a git repo.

4th April

I started building the sentimental analysis model with keras which is high level api deep learning framework. And after training of the model I got an accuracy of 87 % and save the weights of the model, so that when I want make predictions I will just need to the load the model weights. I got sample of the implementation from this links

14th April

By this time I started building the test for the model.
